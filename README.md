# Python a brief introduction to Pytorch

Getting started with PyTorch in VSCode is a great choice for diving into machine learning and deep learning with Python

Here are some simple steps and examples to help you begin your journey:

## 1. Install the Necessary Tools

Before you start coding, you need to have Python and VSCode installed on your computer

Additionally, you will need to install the PyTorch library. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

**Install Python**: Download and install Python from python.org

**Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Download and install VSCode from code.visualstudio.com

**Install the Python extension for VSCode**: Open VSCode, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X, and search for the Python extension by Microsoft and install it

**Install PyTorch**: Open a terminal (or command prompt) and install PyTorch by running the following command:

```
pip install torch torchvision
```

## 2. Set Up a Simple PyTorch Project

Create a new folder for your project and open it in VSCode

Create a new Python file (e.g., simple_example.py)

Write your first PyTorch script. Below is a simple example that creates two tensors and multiplies them:

```python
import torch

# Create tensors.
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
y = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])

# Perform tensor multiplication.
z = x * y

print(z)
```

Run your script by opening the terminal in VSCode (Terminal > New Terminal) and typing **python simple_example.py**
